## 1. A Visual History of Nobel Prize Winners
## Jun 2019
The Nobel Prize is perhaps the world's most well known scientific award. Every year it is given to scientists and scholars in chemistry, literature, physics, medicine, economics, and peace. The first Nobel Prize was handed out in 1901, and at that time the prize was Eurocentric and male-focused, but nowadays it's not biased in any way. Surely, right?

Well, let's find out! In this project, you get to explore patterns and trends in over 100 years worth of Nobel Prize winners. What characteristics do the prize winners have? Which country gets it most often? And has anybody gotten it twice? It's up to you to figure this out.

The dataset used in this project is from The Nobel Foundation on Kaggle.

## 2. Dr. Semmelweis and the Discovery of Handwashing
## Jun 2019
In 1847, the Hungarian physician Ignaz Semmelweis makes a breakthough discovery: He discovers handwashing. Contaminated hands was a major cause of childbed fever and by enforcing handwashing at his hospital he saved hundreds of lives.

In this R project we will reanalyze the medical data Semmelweis collected.

## 3. Exploring the Kaggle Data Science Survey
## Jun 2019
When beginning a career in data science, one often wonders what programming tools and languages one should learn first and what is being used in the industry. By exploring the 2017 Kaggle Data Science Survey results, you can learn about the tools used by 10,000+ people in the professional data science community.

This project uses a subset of the 2017 Kaggle Machine Learning and Data Science Survey dataset. If you want to know more about what tools and techniques Kaggle participants use do check out the full report of the Kaggle 2017 survey results.

## 4. Level Difficulty in Candy Crush Saga
## Jun 2019
Candy Crush Saga is a hit mobile game developed by King (part of Activision|Blizzard) that is played by millions of people all around the world.

In this Project, you will get to work with a real Candy Crush dataset and use this data to estimate level difficulty.

## 5. Phyllotaxis: Draw Flowers Using Mathematics
## Jun 2019
R is a tool for doing serious statistics and data analysis. But not everything in life can be serious, life is also beautiful, and R can make beautiful things too. R can make art.

The arrangement of leaves on a plant stem is ruled by spirals. This fact is called phyllotaxis and it is a nice example of how mathematics can describe patterns in nature. In this project, we will invent flowers using this fact.
